Node inherits a surprising amount of its “low-level super-powers” from the C/C++ world.  Buffers are just the most visible example—behind the scenes many Node core APIs are thin JavaScript wrappers around C/C++ data structures, libraries, or system calls exposed through V8 and **libuv**.  Understanding these cross-language touch-points helps you write faster, leaner code and, when needed, drop down into native land with confidence.  Below is a tour of the main concepts that flow directly from C/C++ into everyday Node programming.

## 1  Binary & shared memory primitives

### 1.1 `Buffer`

A `Buffer` is a C++ object that owns a raw memory slab; JavaScript sees it as a byte array, while C++ code can read/write the same bytes with zero copy ([blog.risingstack.com][1]).

### 1.2 `ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`, `SharedArrayBuffer`

These ECMAScript objects are implemented inside V8 as C++ “backing stores.”  Native addons can create or adopt a backing store to share big numeric datasets across the JS ↔ C++ boundary ([stackoverflow.com][2], [github.com][3]).

## 2  Native addons & the C++ module system

* **Node-API / N-API** – a stable C API (plus `node-addon-api` C++ wrappers) for building native modules that can be loaded with `require()` just like JS files ([nodejs.org][4], [nodejs.org][5]).
* **`process.dlopen()` / `require('bindings')`** – mechanics used by packages such as `bcrypt`, `better-sqlite3`, or `node-sass` to ship pre-compiled `.node` binaries.
* **`AsyncWorker`, `ThreadSafeFunction`** helpers—implemented in C++—let addons run heavy CPU work off the event loop yet deliver callbacks back on the JS thread ([nodejs.org][4]).

## 3  libuv–powered system glue

### 3.1 Event loop & async I/O

Node’s famous single-threaded illusion is driven by the C library **libuv**, which wraps epoll/kqueue/IOCP and ships with a C++ binding layer, exposing timers, poll handles, and a pooled worker thread-pool for file, DNS, and crypto ops ([nodejs.org][6], [medium.com][7]).

### 3.2 Timers

`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `setImmediate` are thin JS facades over libuv timer handles implemented in C ([nodejs.org][6]).

### 3.3 File system

All `fs` methods ultimately call libuv’s `uv_fs_*` C wrappers around POSIX or Windows syscalls; large file copies, reads, writes, and `stat` therefore bypass JS overhead ([nodejs.org][8]).

### 3.4 Networking sockets & TLS

TCP/UDP handles and TLS hand-shakes run in C via libuv and linked OpenSSL, with Node’s JavaScript `net`, `dgram`, and `tls` modules providing ergonomic wrappers ([nodejs.org][9]).

---

## 4  Streams & back-pressure

Node streams use C++ internals for buffering, high-water-mark checks, and integration with libuv file or socket handles.  The JS layer just orchestrates readable/writable events while back-pressure logic lives in core C++ ([nodejs.org][10], [medium.com][11]).

---

## 5  Cryptography bindings

The `node:crypto` module is a set of C++ wrappers around **OpenSSL**’s C API—hashes, ciphers, key-pairs, X.509 parsing—all executed natively for speed and constant-time safety ([nodejs.org][9]).

---

## 6  `process.binding()` and internal C++ stubs

Node’s own JS files call `process.binding('fs')`, `process.binding('buffer')`, etc., to reach hand-written C++ “binding” files embedded in the source tree.  These expose otherwise-private functions such as `fs.open`, `tty.setRawMode`, and fast buffer constructors ([medium.com][12]).

---

## 7  Worker threads & atomics

The `worker_threads` module maps to libuv’s thread-pool and C++ `uv_cond_t`/`uv_mutex_t` primitives, while `Atomics.wait`/`notify` operate on shared memory backed by V8’s C++ `BackingStore` ([github.com][3]).

---

## 8  Why Node keeps leaning on C/C++

* **Performance** – hot paths (crypto, zlib, HTTP parser) stay native.
* **Portability** – libuv abstracts OS differences once at the C layer.
* **Ecosystem leverage** – millions of existing C/C++ libraries (OpenSSL, zlib, libuv, nghttp2) become instantly available to JavaScript developers.

### Key takeaway

Beyond Buffers, almost every “systems-y” API in Node—event loop, timers, streams, crypto, filesystem, worker threads, and addon ecosystem—relies on C/C++ engines or bindings.  Learning these underpinnings unlocks better mental models for performance tuning and opens the door to writing your own high-speed native extensions when JavaScript alone isn’t enough.
